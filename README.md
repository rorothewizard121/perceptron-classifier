# perceptron-classifier
Implementation of a Single Perceptron Classifier With Plotted results.
With this project i wanted to implement a simple perceptron binary binary classifier. 

## Libraries used:
- sklearn (make_blobs for generating data)
- matplotlib (plotting)
- NumPy (math)

## Features:
- Binary classification of linearly seperable data
- Plotting of decision boundaries
